    <p>La comida favorita del Santi</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large chicken breasts cut in half lengthwise</li>
      <li>Flour for dredging</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter divided</li>
      <li>1 whole head garlic cloves peeled</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chicken broth or stock</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy/whipping cream</li>
      <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Parsley chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the chicken in half lengthwise so you have 4 smaller cutlets.
        Sprinkle them with some salt & pepper and coat them in the flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the olive oil and 1 tbsp of the butter to a skillet over medium-high
        heat. Once the pan is hot, saut√© the chicken for 4-5 minutes/side or
        until it's nice and golden. Take the chicken out of the pan and set it
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium (or even med-low if using cast iron), and add
        the rest of the butter to the pan. Let it melt and then add the garlic
        cloves. Cook them for 3-4 minutes, stirring often, until they're lightly
        browned on the outside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken broth, lemon juice, and garlic powder to the pan. Let it
        bubble for around 4 minutes or until the liquid is noticeably reduced.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the cream and add the chicken back into the pan. Let it cook for
        another 5 minutes or so, until the sauce is reduced and the chicken is
        cooked through. Serve with freshly chopped parsley if you wish.
      </li>
    </ol>
